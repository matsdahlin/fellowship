# The fellowship of the tretton37

## Chosen user stories

- ### No UI framework used (such as Bootstrap, Ant) **(1 pt)**

  I wanted to show that I can use HTML and CSS without a framework, and a framework would be adding to both the complexity and bundle size of this small solution.

- ### Build your own API by scraping the current page **(4 pt)**

  This was a good opportunity to show that I know more languages than javascript, and I still enjoy doing backend development. I used dotnet 5 since I have worked with dotnet many years and like to use dotnet core / 5.

- ### CI/CD pipeline from your repo **(1 pt)**

  I choose this because I feel working CI/CD contributes so much to the overall progress of a project, and it makes everyday life easier for both developers, testers, project management and customers/stakeholders.

- ### End-to-end testing (with an existing framework) **(2 pt)**

  This was chosen because I strongly believe that end-to-end testing is very valuable and delivers more "bang for the buck" than unit tests. Both are important, but if I have to choose only one testing strategy I would go for end-to-end tests.
